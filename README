Mark 2-person posts on Google+ as "Private"

This Greasemonkey script changes the audience text (that bit at the top of
each post that says "Limited" or "Public") to instead say "Private" if that
post has been shared only with two people (i.e. you and another user,
otherwise you wouldn't be able to see the post in the first place).

Caveat emptor:  whenever Google updates G+ and changes the layout, be
prepared for this script to break.
